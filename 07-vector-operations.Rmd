# Vector operations

## Loading vectors

Load the vector shapefile of EU countries:
```{r}
eu <- vect("data/EU/EU.shp")
eu
```

This vector contains the polygons of 27 countries in the European Union (EU).
Additionally, an attribute table is attached to it, providing information about the country name, the ISO3 code, etc.
You can see full list of attributes using `names(eu)`:

```{r}
names(eu)
```
