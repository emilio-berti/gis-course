# Vectors or Geometries

Vectors (or shapefiles) contain geospatial vector data, also called geometries.
A shapefile has the extension _.shp_ and it is usually accompanied by other files.
Common supplementary files are:

  - _.shx_ = the index of the geometries in the data model.
  - _.dbf_ = the attributes of the geometries in a table format.
  - _.prj_ = the WKT representation of the coordinate reference system.

The core concept of shapefiles is that geographic features are stored using three fundamental geometry types:

  1. Points, defined by coordinates $(x, y)$.
  2. Lines, defined by two points and a line connecting them.
  3. Polygons, defiend by several lines.

These three fundamental types can also be "stacked", e.g. one spatial feature can be represented by multiple points, lines, and polygons.
In this case, we talk of _multipoints_, _multilines_, and _multipolygons_.
The difference between multilines and polygons is that a polygon inscribe an area of space, that is it creates an "inside" area and an "outside" one, while multilines do not.

## Geometries in R

In `terra`, all the hustle that came with older GIS software has been removed, and geometries can be simply be created using the `vect()` function.

```{r}
xy <- matrix(c(0, 0), ncol = 2)
poi <- vect(xy)
geomtype(poi)
```

This creates our first geometry, a point at the origin.
To be meaningful, however, we must assign a coordinate reference system to our geometry.
This can be done during the initialization itself.

```{r}
poi <- vect(xy, crs = "EPSG:4326")
poi
```

Geometries can be converted into other types by _casting_.
In `terra` this has been made extremely easy.
Let's create some points.

```{r}
xy <- matrix(seq_len(10), ncol = 2)
pois <- vect(xy, crs = "EPSG:4326")
geomtype(pois)
```

And cast them to lines using `as.lines()`.

```{r}
ls <- as.lines(pois)
geomtype(ls)
```

We may want to cast this to polygons, notice however that these lines do not inscribe an area of space, i.e. they are not "closed".

```{r}
plot(ls)
points(pois, cex = 2)
```

Trying to cast these lines as polygons, will return an empty geometry.

```{r}
pol = as.polygons(ls)
geomtype(pol)
```

To cast lines to polygons, two points must be identical.

```{r}
xy <- matrix(seq_len(10), ncol = 2)
xy <- rbind(xy, cbind(5, 6))  # add bottom-right point
xy <- rbind(xy, xy[1, ])  # add again first point
pois <- vect(xy, crs = "EPSG:4326")
ls <- as.lines(pois)
pol <- as.polygons(ls)
pol

# show it
plot(pol, col = "dodgerblue", alpha = .5)
lines(ls, col = "tomato", lw = 3)
points(pois, cex = 3)
```

If you want to cast points to polygons, it is considered best practice to first cast them to lines and then cast these into polygons (as I just did).
Trying to cast points to polygons directly can introduce errors, if it works at all.

Each geometry has its own set of properties.
Points have coordinates:

```{r points-properties}
geom(pois)[, c("x", "y")]  # coordinates of points
```

Lines have length:

```{r lines-properties}
perim(ls)  # length of line
```

And polygons have perimeter and area:

```{r polygons-properties}
perim(pol)  # perimeter of polygon
expanse(pol, unit = "km")  # area of polygon
```

Note that lines and polygons also have coordinates, which are the breaking points of the straight lines, defined by the points:

```{r properties}
geom(pol)
```

## Create geometry in R interactively

A nice feature of `terra` is that it allows to draw on a plot and save the resulting geometry in the environment.
This is achieved using the function `draw()`, which takes as argument the type of geometry you want to draw (_points_, _line_, _polygon_, or _extent_).
```{r draw, eval=FALSE}
plot(pol, col = "dodgerblue3", alpha = .5)
drawing = draw("lines")
```
And then just left-click on the map.
When you are done, right click and the output will be saved in the variable `drawing`.

This is very useful when you want to zoom on a region of a map or draw coarse polygons but don't want to open a more interactive GIS software, such as QGIS.

## Reading and writing shapefiles

The function `vect()` is also used to read shapefiles:

```{r read-shapes, eval=FALSE}
vect(<filename>)
```

To write shapefiles, use `writeVector()`.

```{r write-shapes, eval=FALSE}
writeVector(<spatVect>, <filename>)
```
