# Preface {-}

I started learning GIS in 2017 during my PhD.
As most of the programming I know, I learnt it by myself making many mistakes.
I still make mistakes, which means I am still learning.
My aim with this book is to be the guide I did not have when I started learning GIS and that would have saved me some of the mistakes.
This book is intended for newcomers to GIS; experienced users should definitely look for what they search somewhere else (most likely on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)).

The book is divided into three main parts:
  1. General introduction to GIS.
  2. Fundamentals for GIS analysis.
  3. GIS analysis with Google Earth Engine.

## Software requirements {-}

In the first part of this book, I will introduce the basic concepts of GIS  using R and Python.
For this, I will use the _terra_ package for R and the _shapely_ module for Python.

In the second part, I will cover the fundamentals of GIS analysis.
I will explain the theory behind it and complement it with examples from actual analyses, introducing the most common workflows for R and Python.
I will use the R package _terra_ and the Python moduels _shapely_, _geopandas_, _fiona_, and _plotly_.

In the third part, I will focus on Google Earth Engine and explain how to move heavy GIS analyses on the cloud.
This will require a basic understanding of JavaScript and of Python object-oriented programming, as well as to interface with GEE using the _gee_ Python module.
This part may seem redunant at first (why should I move my computation on Google servers?), but, as your analyses expand in scale and need to access several databases, GEE shines as a great trade-off between complexity and effectiveness.

To install all packages and modules used in this book, you can use the ![conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) environment management system.
The environment file is at ![https://github.com/emilio-berti/gis-course/conda/gis-course.yml](https://github.com/emilio-berti/gis-course/conda/gis-course.yml.

```bash
conda create -n gis-course -f gis-course.yml
```

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(terra)
```
