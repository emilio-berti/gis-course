# Preface {-}

I started learning GIS in 2017 during my PhD.
As most of the programming I know, I learnt it by myself making many mistakes.
I still make mistakes, which means I am still learning.
My aim with this book is to be the guide I did not have when I started learning GIS and that would have saved me some of the mistakes.
This book is intended for newcomers to GIS; experienced users should definitely look for what they search somewhere else (most likely on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)).
